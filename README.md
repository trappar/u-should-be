#### Play guitar! :)

A service that helps you make decisions based on your priorities, while keeping things fresh.

This repository is currently a work in progress and is non-functional.

## Developing

#### Pre-requisites

In order to work on this project you will need the following software installed on your computer:

* PHP
* NodeJS/NPM
* Grunt CLI (available from NPM `npm install -g grunt-cli`)

The remainder of the vendor files are installed with the following commands:

* `npm install`
* `composer install`

Once the project is ready, you can use the following commands to compile dev assets and boot a dev server:

* `grunt` (this watch task will monitor static assets for changes and automatically recompile them)
* `app/console server:start` (this will launch PHP's built in server - accessable at localhost:8000)
